Sales Analysis 
Randy Gomez
This program simulates a stores analysis in sales, the revenue and profit.
The program uses the user input of what file to input and what decision to make wether they want the total amount of revenue, the total profits, or the profits and revenue of one specific item.
The user has to input the file they want to get from, the txt file they want to pull from the information.
To compile:
gcc analyze_sales.c sales_functions.c -o runSales
Or 
To make it run 
./runSales
You will be prompted to enter which program youd like to run(enter 1, 2, or 3)
Sources: this program was made by Randy with a little help from lecture slides and examples within the class files to see how to bridge between two files.
